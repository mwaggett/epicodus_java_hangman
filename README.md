# Hangman ~UNFINISHED~

##### _Objects Inside Objects practice for Epicodus, 19 August 2015_

#### By **Perry Eising & Molly Waggett**

## Description

This app allows the user to play a game of Hangman. A word is randomly chosen from a preset dictionary and the user must guess guess letters one at a time. An incorrect guess results in another part of the hangman's body being added to the gallows. _**We currently have only the head of the hangman being built. We also are not yet displaying the number of blanks in the word to be guessed.**_
